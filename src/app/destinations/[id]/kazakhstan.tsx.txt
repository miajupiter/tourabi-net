    <h2 className='text-4xl mt-10 mb-10'>Kazakhstan</h2>
    <div className='my-4'>Kazakhstan Travel brings you to the heart of Eurasia, a clash of time and cultures at the confluence of nomadic, Soviet and 21st-century history. Stand on the brink of the world’s largest steppe, an endless ocean of pasturelands marked by ripples of mountains, wildflowers and sleepy towns. Travel cross-country on the modern-day Orient Express, passing the fields where freedom-loving tribes once tamed the wild horse.</div>
    <div className='my-4'>Straddling this vast expanse, stretching from the Caspian Sea to China, are cities layered with remnants of the past and bold displays of innovative architecture, while national parks the size of countries are cloaked in a myriad of natural colors which mirror each season.</div>
    <div className='my-4'>Kazakhstan’s tenacious people, eager that their country and national values be known by the world, welcome visitors with open arms and traditional hospitality. This is a journey well worth taking!</div>

    <h3 className='text-2xl mt-10 mb-10'>Kazakhstan Visiting</h3>
    <div className='my-4'>Central Asia’s largest and most influential nation has garnered worldwide recognition for its oil industry and progressive aspirations, and its tourist attractions deserve equal recognition. Just a few reasons to consider Kazakhstan for your next vacation:</div>
    <div className='my-4'>Almaty Region alone provides so much cultural and natural entertainment that many visitors never make it past this point. Former capital Almaty is filled with fun parks, bazaars, malls and museums, while surrounding mountains offer seasonal sports, cable car rides and endless hiking opportunities.</div>
    <div className='my-4'>Current capital Astana defies stereotypes right and left. Tour Hazrat Sultan, the largest mosque in Central Asia, before wiling away the time in Khan-Shatyr, the world’s most stylish tent. Take a boat tour and a national cooking class before heading out to popular nature reserves.</div>
    <div className='my-4'>Southern Kazakhstan is the destination of choice for history lovers. Ancient Turkestan, Otrar, Sayram and Arslanbob are replete with traces of Silk Road mystery, while local hub Shymkent impressively fuses traditional Central Asian culture with modernity.</div>

    <h3 className='text-2xl mt-10 mb-10'>Your Dream Vacation</h3>
    <div className='my-4'>Kazakhstan is brimming with both traditional and out-of-the-ordinary travel experiences. Wander the remains of Tamerlane-era towns, view cosmopolitan cities from the vantage of a cable car or leave your troubles behind amid the finely crafted peaks and canyons that dot the wild landscape.</div>
    <div className='my-4'>Float down a river through the gleaming capital city or learn the local art of falcon hunting. Stand at one of the lowest points on the planet in an arid depression or do figure 8s on the highest ice rink in the world. Taste Kazakh, Russian, Uzbek and Uyghur cuisine as you bargain for authentic souvenirs and enjoy endless photo ops along the way.</div>
